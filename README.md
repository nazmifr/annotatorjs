# AnnotatorJS, the kiss web-based annotator tool for youtube and vimeo
This tool is aimed at musical lyrics writers, translators, fansubbers, transcribers, reviewers, debunkers and everyone who needs a way to write stuff while playing a video.

Say you're watching a video and want to take notes, transcribe what's being said or shown or just list the assertions that are made, you can either play and pause it, or if you're fast try to live caption it and transcode all your notes in real time (I'm pretty fast at doing that and in 5 years of training, I can only hold for 1-2 minutes).

Here's a script that does what I've dreamt for years, pause the video when i'm writing!

Now the transcript goes at MY pace, not the video's!

If this script was helpful to you, you may donate any amount to support my (work)[https://meca.land/en] at:

## Other use-cases

If you want to annotate a video with bounding boxes to track movement, this python tool will do, I was misled to it thinking it was what I wanted, then I ended up writing this little javascript script:

## Todo:

(Commits and suggestions are welcome!)
- Add support for HTML5 video
- Add more video hosts (peertube, twitter, dailymotion, ok.ru, facebook, instagram)
- Shortcuts to play/pause/disable auto-pause/seek +/- 10 seconds
- Automatic backup of the transcript
- Metadata creation in the transcript for long videos (timestamps like in a SRT file)
- Centralised platform to share reviews/transcripts ?
- Finding a way to make the script closedsource, which is really a pain in the b\*tt as everything's client side ðŸ¤”
- Profit!
